/* GDB will never try to install multiple breakpoints at the same
   address.  But, we need to keep track of internal breakpoints too,
   and so we do need to be able to install multiple breakpoints at the
   same address transparently.  We keep track of two different, and
   closely related structures.  A raw breakpoint, which manages the
   low level, close to the metal aspect of a breakpoint.  It holds the
   breakpoint address, and a buffer holding a copy of the instructions
   that would be in memory had not been a breakpoint there (we call
   that the shadow memory of the breakpoint).  We occasionally need to
   temporarilly uninsert a breakpoint without the client knowing about
   it (e.g., to step over an internal breakpoint), so we keep an
   `inserted' state associated with this low level breakpoint
   structure.  There can only be one such object for a given address.
   Then, we have (a bit higher level) breakpoints.  This structure
   holds a callback to be called whenever a breakpoint is hit, a
   high-level type, and a link to a low level raw breakpoint.  There
   can be many high-level breakpoints at the same address, and all of
   them will point to the same raw breakpoint, which is reference
   counted.  */
